# Product Requirements Document: Testing Framework Setup

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive testing framework for the Little Pilgrim's Progress Interactive Game. The goal is to establish a reliable testing infrastructure that enables developers to write and run unit tests, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions throughout the development process.

## Goals

1. **Test Infrastructure**: Establish a robust testing framework that supports unit testing for game components
2. **Code Quality**: Enable developers to write tests that validate game logic and catch bugs early
3. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure that new code changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Developer Confidence**: Provide developers with tools to verify their code works as expected

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to write unit tests for my game components so that I can verify they work correctly
2. **As a developer**, I want to run tests quickly and see clear results so that I can identify and fix issues fast
3. **As a team member**, I want to ensure my changes don't break existing functionality so that the game remains stable
4. **As a developer**, I want clear test output and error messages so that I can understand what went wrong when tests fail

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must install Jest testing framework with configuration suitable for browser-based game development
2. The system must configure Jest to work with TypeScript files and provide proper type checking during tests
3. The system must set up a test environment that can simulate browser APIs (Canvas, Audio, etc.) for game testing
4. The system must create npm scripts for running tests (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
5. The system must configure test coverage reporting to track which code is tested
6. The system must set up a basic test structure with example tests for game components
7. The system must configure Jest to handle asset loading and file imports commonly used in game development
8. The system must ensure tests can run in both development and CI/CD environments

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Browser automation testing will be implemented in later phases
2. **Performance Testing**: Game performance testing tools will be added separately
3. **Visual Regression Testing**: Image-based testing will not be implemented initially
4. **Complex Test Scenarios**: Advanced testing patterns will be added as needed
5. **Test Data Management**: Complex test data setup will be handled on a case-by-case basis

## Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: Keep test setup simple and easy to understand for junior developers
- **Performance**: Tests should run quickly to not slow down the development workflow
- **Clarity**: Test output should be clear and actionable
- **Flexibility**: Test framework should accommodate different types of game components

## Technical Considerations

- **Jest Version**: Use latest stable version with TypeScript support
- **Test Environment**: Configure Jest to work with browser APIs and DOM manipulation
- **Coverage Reporting**: Set up coverage reports to identify untested code
- **Mocking**: Configure Jest to mock browser APIs and external dependencies
- **Asset Handling**: Set up Jest to handle image, audio, and other asset files in tests
- **CI Integration**: Ensure tests can run in automated environments

## Success Metrics

1. **Test Execution Speed**: All tests run in under 10 seconds for typical project size
2. **Coverage Visibility**: Test coverage reports are generated and accessible
3. **False Positives**: Less than 5% of test failures are false positives
4. **Developer Adoption**: 80% of new code includes corresponding unit tests
5. **Test Reliability**: Tests produce consistent results across different environments

## Open Questions

1. Should we create specific test utilities for common game testing patterns (sprite testing, animation testing)?
2. Do we need to configure any specific mocks for HTML5 Canvas or Web Audio APIs?
3. Should we set up any specific test data or fixtures for game state testing?
4. Do we need to configure any specific rules for testing game loop and timing-dependent code?
