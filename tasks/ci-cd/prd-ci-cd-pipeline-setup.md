# Product Requirements Document: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Little Pilgrim's Progress Interactive Game. The goal is to establish automated quality checks that run on every code commit, ensuring code quality, running tests, and preventing broken code from reaching the main codebase.

## Goals

1. **Automated Quality Checks**: Run linting, formatting, and type checking automatically on every commit
2. **Test Automation**: Execute all tests automatically to catch regressions early
3. **Code Quality Enforcement**: Ensure all code meets quality standards before merging
4. **Developer Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback to developers about code quality issues

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want automated checks to run on my code so that I know immediately if there are quality issues
2. **As a team member**, I want to ensure that all merged code meets our quality standards so that the codebase remains clean
3. **As a developer**, I want clear feedback about what needs to be fixed so that I can address issues quickly
4. **As a team lead**, I want to prevent broken code from reaching the main branch so that the project stays stable

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must configure GitHub Actions workflow to run on every push and pull request
2. The system must set up automated linting checks using ESLint to catch code quality issues
3. The system must configure automated code formatting checks using Prettier to ensure consistent style
4. The system must set up automated TypeScript type checking to catch type-related errors
5. The system must configure automated test execution using Jest to catch functional regressions
6. The system must set up automated test coverage reporting to track code coverage trends
7. The system must configure required status checks for pull requests to prevent merging broken code
8. The system must provide clear, actionable error messages when checks fail

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Production Deployment**: Actual deployment to production servers will be handled separately
2. **Performance Testing**: Automated performance testing will be added in later phases
3. **Security Scanning**: Security vulnerability scanning will be implemented separately
4. **Complex Workflows**: Advanced CI/CD patterns will be added as needed
5. **Multi-Environment Testing**: Testing across multiple environments will be handled later

## Design Considerations

- **Speed**: CI/CD checks should complete quickly to provide fast feedback
- **Reliability**: Pipeline should be stable and not produce false positives
- **Clarity**: Error messages should be clear and actionable
- **Simplicity**: Keep the pipeline simple and easy to understand

## Technical Considerations

- **GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform
- **Node.js Environment**: Configure actions to run in Node.js environment
- **Caching**: Implement caching for dependencies to speed up builds
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent checks in parallel where possible
- **Status Checks**: Configure required status checks for pull request merging
- **Notifications**: Set up appropriate notifications for pipeline failures

## Success Metrics

1. **Pipeline Speed**: All checks complete in under 5 minutes
2. **Reliability**: Pipeline succeeds 95% of the time when code is properly formatted and tested
3. **Feedback Time**: Developers receive feedback within 5 minutes of pushing code
4. **False Positives**: Less than 5% of pipeline failures are false positives
5. **Developer Adoption**: 100% of team members use the pipeline for quality validation

## Open Questions

1. Should we add any specific checks for game-specific code patterns or conventions?
2. Do we need to configure any specific checks for asset file validation?
3. Should we set up any specific notifications for pipeline failures (Slack, email, etc.)?
4. Do we need to configure any specific rules for handling third-party dependencies or security updates?
