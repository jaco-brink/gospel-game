# Product Requirements Document: Development Environment Setup

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for setting up the foundational development environment for the Little Pilgrim's Progress Interactive Game. The goal is to establish a clean, efficient development workspace that enables smooth collaboration and maintains code quality standards. This setup will serve as the foundation for all subsequent game development tasks.

## Goals

1. **Project Initialization**: Create a properly structured Node.js project with all necessary configuration files
2. **Development Server**: Establish a local development server running on port 3456 for real-time development
3. **Version Control**: Set up Git repository with appropriate ignore patterns for the game development workflow
4. **Project Metadata**: Configure package.json with accurate project information and essential scripts

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to clone the repository and run a single command to start development so that I can begin coding immediately
2. **As a developer**, I want the development server to automatically reload when I make changes so that I can see updates instantly
3. **As a team member**, I want consistent project structure so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase
4. **As a developer**, I want clear documentation on how to set up the environment so that new team members can get started quickly

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must initialize a Git repository with a comprehensive .gitignore file that excludes node_modules, build artifacts, and development-specific files
2. The system must create a package.json file with project metadata including name, version, description, and author information
3. The system must configure a local development server that runs on port 3456 as specified in project requirements
4. The system must include npm scripts for common development tasks (start, build, test, lint)
5. The system must set up a basic project folder structure with directories for source code, assets, and documentation
6. The system must create a README.md file with setup instructions and project overview
7. The system must configure the development server to serve static files from appropriate directories
8. The system must enable hot reloading for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files during development

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Production Deployment**: This setup is for development only; production deployment configuration will be handled separately
2. **Advanced Build Tools**: Complex bundling and optimization will be implemented in later phases
3. **Database Setup**: No database configuration is needed for this initial setup
4. **External Service Integration**: No third-party services or APIs will be configured at this stage
5. **Mobile Development**: This setup is focused on web browser development only

## Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: The setup should be as simple as possible while still being functional
- **Documentation**: All setup steps should be clearly documented for new developers
- **Consistency**: Follow standard Node.js project conventions and best practices
- **Portability**: The setup should work consistently across different operating systems

## Technical Considerations

- **Node.js Version**: Target Node.js 18+ for modern JavaScript features
- **Package Manager**: Use npm as the primary package manager
- **Development Server**: Use a simple, fast development server (Vite recommended for simplicity)
- **File Structure**: Organize files logically for a game development project
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the development server works with modern browsers

## Success Metrics

1. **Setup Time**: New developers can set up the environment in under 5 minutes
2. **Server Startup**: Development server starts in under 3 seconds
3. **Hot Reload**: File changes are reflected in the browser within 1 second
4. **Documentation**: README.md contains all necessary setup instructions
5. **Script Functionality**: All npm scripts execute without errors

## Open Questions

1. Should we include any specific game development libraries in the initial setup, or add them as needed?
2. Do we need to configure any specific browser developer tools or extensions?
3. Should we set up any specific IDE configurations or editor settings?
4. Do we need to configure any environment-specific variables for different development stages?
