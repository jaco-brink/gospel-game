## Task Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Tasks (Must be completed in order):
1. **Phase 0 Foundation**: TASK-000 → TASK-001 → TASK-002 → TASK-003 (Development environment and code quality setup)
2. **Core Movement**: TASK-004 → TASK-005 → TASK-006 (Character movement system)
3. **Story Foundation**: TASK-010 → TASK-013 → TASK-014 (Story system foundation)
4. **Asset Creation**: TASK-023 → TASK-021 → TASK-022 (Asset creation before story implementation)

### Phase 0 Prerequisites:
- All Phase 1+ tasks depend on Phase 0 completion
- Code quality tools must be in place before any game development begins
- Testing framework must be established before implementing game systems

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- Audio system (TASK-018, TASK-019, TASK-020) can be developed alongside story content
- UI refinement (TASK-025, TASK-026) can be done in parallel with story implementation
- Testing (TASK-029, TASK-030) should be ongoing throughout development

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team:
- **Game Developer**: Primary implementation of game systems

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks:
- **TASK-021, TASK-022**: Large scope, consider breaking into smaller tasks
- **TASK-023, TASK-024**: Asset creation may take longer than estimated
- **TASK-030**: User testing may reveal significant UX issues

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Start asset creation early in parallel with development
- Break large story tasks into weekly milestones
- Conduct early user testing with prototypes
- Maintain flexible scope for non-critical features

## Notes

- All tasks should include unit tests where applicable
- Local development server should run on port 3456
- Focus on educational value and age-appropriate content
- Maintain consistent 60fps performance target
- Prioritize accessibility and ease of use for young players
