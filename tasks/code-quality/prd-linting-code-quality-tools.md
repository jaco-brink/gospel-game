# Product Requirements Document: Linting and Code Quality Tools Setup

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive linting and code quality tools for the Little Pilgrim's Progress Interactive Game. The goal is to establish automated code quality checks that ensure consistent code style, catch potential errors early, and maintain high code standards throughout the development process.

## Goals

1. **Code Consistency**: Ensure all code follows consistent formatting and style guidelines
2. **Error Prevention**: Catch syntax errors, potential bugs, and code quality issues before they reach production
3. **Automated Quality Checks**: Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically validate code quality
4. **Developer Experience**: Provide clear feedback and suggestions for code improvements

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want my code to be automatically formatted so that I don't have to worry about style consistency
2. **As a developer**, I want to catch syntax errors and potential bugs before committing so that I can fix issues early
3. **As a team member**, I want consistent code style across the entire codebase so that the code is easy to read and maintain
4. **As a developer**, I want clear error messages when my code doesn't meet quality standards so that I can quickly fix issues

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must install and configure ESLint with recommended JavaScript rules for catching common errors and enforcing best practices
2. The system must install and configure Prettier with default settings for automatic code formatting
3. The system must set up npm scripts for linting (lint) and formatting (format) that can be run manually
4. The system must configure Prettier to work with ESLint without conflicts
5. The system must create appropriate configuration files (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc) with project-specific settings
6. The system must add .prettierignore file to exclude files that should not be formatted
7. The system must configure the development environment to show linting errors and warnings in real-time
8. The system must ensure that all configuration files are committed to version control for team consistency

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Complex Custom Rules**: Advanced ESLint rules beyond the recommended set will not be implemented initially
2. **IDE-Specific Configuration**: IDE-specific linting configurations will be handled separately
3. **Performance Optimization**: Code performance analysis tools will be implemented in later phases
4. **Security Scanning**: Security-focused linting rules will be added in future iterations
5. **Documentation Generation**: Automated documentation generation from code comments will be handled separately

## Design Considerations

- **Simplicity**: Use default configurations where possible to minimize complexity
- **Consistency**: Ensure all team members have the same linting experience
- **Performance**: Linting should be fast enough to not slow down development workflow
- **Clarity**: Error messages should be clear and actionable

## Technical Considerations

- **ESLint Version**: Use latest stable version with recommended rules
- **Prettier Integration**: Configure ESLint and Prettier to work together without conflicts
- **Configuration Files**: Use JavaScript configuration files for better flexibility
- **Ignore Patterns**: Properly configure ignore files to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
- **Script Integration**: Ensure linting scripts integrate well with the existing npm workflow

## Success Metrics

1. **Error Detection**: ESLint catches 95% of common JavaScript errors and code quality issues
2. **Formatting Speed**: Prettier formats code in under 1 second for typical file sizes
3. **Configuration Consistency**: All developers use identical linting and formatting rules
4. **False Positives**: Less than 5% of linting warnings are false positives
5. **Developer Adoption**: 100% of team members use the linting tools in their workflow

## Open Questions

1. Should we add any specific ESLint plugins for game development patterns?
2. Do we need to configure different linting rules for different file types (HTML, CSS, JSON)?
3. Should we set up any specific rules for handling game-specific code patterns?
4. Do we need to configure any specific rules for handling third-party libraries or APIs?
